This project is a website designed to help users manage their personal book collection. It allows users to add books by providing details such as title, author, number of pages, and additional notes they might want to include. Additionally, they can edit their information, delete individual books from the collection as needed, and toggle their read status. The website was built with accessibility elements and a responsive layout in mind.
